# .bash.d

My personal bash configuration files. Mostly revolving around `git` and `ruby`.

## Features (WIP)

* Displays current git branch, clean / dirty state within repositories
* The ruby version, provided both a Gemfile and git repo are present
* If within a git repo the path relative to the git root, instead of the absolute path
* Truncates current working directory path, if it's larger than a certain percentage of the viewport
